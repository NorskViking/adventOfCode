## About the Project
This is my collection of solutions for the Advent of Code programming challenges, solved using Typescript in Node.js.

Each year and day have their own solution and input files.

To run the code:
```bash
npm run dev <year>\day<num>\solution.ts

npx tsx <year>\day<num>\solution.ts 
```
